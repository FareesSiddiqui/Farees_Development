# Farees_Development

**Project Status: Finished**

This is a remake of the classical game Flappy bird with a Machine Learning algorithm (Neuro Evolution of Augmented Topologies) to make an unbeatable bot for it. The game was made using pygame for the actual game and the python neat module for the AI

To install the required dependencies for this project, download this REPO, change directory into the repo's directory and run the command ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` it should install two extra dependencies (neat-python and pygame)
