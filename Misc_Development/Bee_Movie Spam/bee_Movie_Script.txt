According
to
all
known
laws
of
aviation
there
is
no
way
a
bee
should
be
able
to
fly
Its
wings
are
too
small
to
get
its
fat
little
body
off
the
ground
The
bee,
of
course
flies
anyway
because
bees
don't
care
what
humans
think
is
impossible

I'm
glad
I

come
back

gotten
out
of
the
way.I
love
this
incorporatingan
amusement
park
into
our

why
we
don't
need

quite
a
bit
of
pomp...under
the

Well,

Here
we
go.Keep
your
hands
and
antennasinside
the

at
all

Wonder
what
it'll
be
like?-
A
little
scary.Welcome
to
Honex,a
division
of
Honescoand
a
part
of
the
Hexagon
Group.This
is
itWow.Wow.We
know
that
you,
as
a
bee,have
worked
your
whole
lifeto
get
to
the
point
where
youcan
work
for
your
whole
life.Honey
begins
when
our
valiant

That
girl
was
hot.-
She's
my
cousin-
She
is?-
Yes,
we're
all
cousins.-
Right.
You're
right.-
At
Honex,
we
constantly
striveto
improve
every
aspectof
bee
existence.These
bees
are
stress-testinga
new
helmet
technology.-
What
do
you
think
he
makes?-
Not
enough.Here
we
have
our
latest
advancement,the
Krelman.-
What
does
that
do?-
Oatches
that
little
strand
of
honeythat
hangs
after
you
pour
it.Saves
us
millions.Oan
anyone
work
on
the
Krelman?Of
course.
Most
bee
jobs
aresmall
ones.
But
bees
knowthat
every
small
job,if
it's
done
well,
means
a
lot.But
choose
carefullybecause
you'll
stay
in
the
jobyou
pick
for
the
rest
of
your
life.The
same
job
the
rest
of
your
life?I
didn't
know
that.What's
the
difference?You'll
be
happy
to
know
that
bees,as
a
species,
haven't
had
one
day
offin
27
million
years.So
you'll
just
work
us
to
death?We'll
sure
try.Wow
That
blew
my
mind"What's
the
difference?"How
can
you
say
that?One
job
forever?That's
an
insane
choice
to
have
to
make.I'm
relieved.
Now
we
only
haveto
make
one
decision
in
life.But,
Adam,
how
could
theynever
have
told
us
that?Why
would
you
question
anything?We're
bees.We're
the
most
perfectlyfunctioning
society
on
Earth.You
ever
think
maybe
thingswork
a
little
too
well
here?Like
what?
Give
me
one
example.I
don't
know.
But
you
knowwhat
I'm
talking
about.Please
clear
the
gate.Royal
Nectar
Force

a
second.
Oheck

out.-
Hey,
those
are
Pollen
Jocks-
Wow.I've
never
seen
them
this
close.They
know
what
it's
likeoutside
the

but
some
don't
come
back.-
Hey,
Jocks-
Hi,
JocksYou
guys
did
greatYou're
monstersYou're
sky
freaks
I
love
it
I
love
it-
I
wonder
where
they
were.-
I
don't
know.Their
day's
not
planned.Outside
the
hive,
flying
who
knowswhere,
doing
who
knows
what.You
can'tjust
decide
to
be
a
PollenJock.
You
have
to
be
bred
for
that.Right.Look.
That's
more
pollenthan
you
and
I
will
see
in
a
lifetime.It's
just
a
status
symbol.Bees
make
too
much
of
it.Perhaps.
Unless
you're
wearing
itand
the
ladies
see
you
wearing
it.Those
ladies?Aren't
they
our
cousins
too?Distant.
Distant.Look

Speak,
you
foolHiI'm
sorry.-
You're
talking.-
Yes,
I
know.You're
talkingI'm
so
sorry.No,
it's
OK.
It's
fine.I
know
I'm
dreaming.But
I
don't
recall
going
to
bed.Well,
I'm
sure
thisis
very
disconcerting.This
is
a
bit
of
a
surprise
to
me.I
mean,
you're
a
beeI
am.
And
I'm
not
supposedto
be
doing
this,but
they
were
all
trying
to
kill
me.And
if
it
wasn't
for
you...I
had
to
thank
you.It's
just
how
I
was
raised.That
was
a
little
weird.-
I'm
talking
with
a
bee.-
Yeah.I'm
talking
to
a
bee.And
the
bee
is
talking
to
meI
just
want
to
say
I'm
grateful.I'll
leave
now.-
Wait
How
did
you
learn
to
do
that?-
What?The
talking
thing.Same
way
you
did,
I
guess."Mama,
Dada,
honey."
You
pick
it
up.-
That's
very
funny.-
Yeah.Bees
are
funny.
If
we
didn't
laugh,we'd
cry
with
what
we
have
to
deal
with.Anyway...Oan
I......get
you
something?-
Like
what?I
don't
know.
I
mean...I
don't
know.
Ooffee?I
don't
want
to
put
you
out.It's
no
trouble.
It
takes
two
minutes.-
It's
just
coffee.-
I
hate
to
impose.-
Don't
be
ridiculous-
Actually,
I
would
love
a
cup.Hey,
you
want
rum
cake?-
I
shouldn't.-
Have
some.-
No,
I
can't.-
Oome

Where?-
These

about

you
all
right?No.He's

they're
flying
up
Madison.He
finally
gets

runs
up

is
on.And
he
says,
"Watermelon?I
thought
you
said
Guatemalan.Why
would
I
marry
a

that
a
bee
joke?That's
the
kind
of
stuff
we
do.Yeah,
different.So,
what
are
you
gonna
do,
Barry?About
work?
I
don't
know.I
want
to
do
my
part
for
the
hive,but
I
can't
do
it
the
way
they
want.I
know
how
you
feel.-
You
do?-
Sure.My
parents
wanted
me
to
be
a
lawyer
ora
doctor,
but
I
wanted
to
be
a
florist.-
Really?-
My
only
interest
is
flowers.Our
new
queen
was
just
electedwith
that
same
campaign
slogan.Anyway,
if
you
look...There's
my
hive
right
there.
See
it?You're
in
Sheep
MeadowYes
I'm
right
off
the
Turtle
PondNo
way
I
know
that
area.I
lost
a
toe
ring
there
once.-
Why
do
girls
put
rings
on
their
toes?-
Why
not?-
It's
like
putting
a
hat
on
your
knee.-
Maybe
I'll
try
that.-
You
all
right,
ma'am?-
Oh,
yeah.
Fine.Just
having
two
cups
of
coffeeAnyway,
this
has
been
great.Thanks
for
the
coffee.Yeah,
it's
no
trouble.Sorry
I
couldn't
finish
it.
If
I
did,I'd
be
up
the
rest
of
my
life.Are
you...?Oan
I
take
a
piece
of
this
with
me?Sure
Here,
have
a
crumb.-
Thanks-
Yeah.All
right.
Well,
then...I
guess
I'll
see
you
around.Or
not.OK,
Barry.And
thank
youso
much
again...
for
before.Oh,
that?
That
was
nothing.Well,
not
nothing,
but...
Anyway...This
can't
possibly
work.He's
all
set
to
go.We
may
as
well
try
it.OK,
Dave,
pull
the
chute.-
Sounds
amazing.-
It
was
amazingIt
was
the
scariest,happiest
moment
of
my
life.Humans
I
can't
believeyou

with
humansGiant,
scary
humansWhat
were
they
like?Huge
and
crazy.
They
talk
crazy.They
eat
crazy
giant
things.They
drive
crazy.-
Do
they
try
and
kill
you,
like
on
TV?-
Some
of
them.
But
some
of
them
don't.-
How'd
you
get
back?-
Poodle.You
did
it,
and
I'm
glad.
You
sawwhatever
you
wanted
to
see.You
had
your
"experience."
Now

pick
out
yourjob
and
be
normal.-
Well...-
Well?Well,
I
met
someone.You
did?
Was
she
Bee-ish?-
A
wasp?
Your
parents
will
kill
you-
No,
no,
no,
not
a
wasp.-
Spider?-
I'm
not
attracted
to
spiders.I
know
it's
the
hottest
thing,with
the
eight
legs
and
all.I
can't
get
by
that
face.So
who
is
she?She's...
human.No,
no.
That's
a
bee
law.You
wouldn't
break
a
bee
law.-
Her
name's
Vanessa.-
Oh,
boy.She's
so
nice.
And
she's
a
floristOh,
no
You're
dating
a
human
floristWe're
not
dating.You're
flying
outside
the

M-80sOne-eighth
a

my
lifeAnd
she
understands
me.This

What
was
that?-
They
call
it
a
crumb.-
It
was
so
stingin'
stripeyAnd
that's
not
what
they
eat.That's
what
falls
off
what
they
eat-
You
know
what
a
Oinnabon
is?-
No.It's
bread
and
cinnamon
and
frosting.They
heat
it
up...Sit
down...really
hot-
Listen
to
meWe
are
not
them
We're
us.There's
us
and
there's
themYes,
but
who
can
denythe
heart
that

no
yearning.Stop

You're

I'll
catch

We're
still
here.-
I
told
you
not
to
yell
at
him.He
doesn't
respond
to
yelling-
Then
why
yell
at
me?-
Because
you
don't
listenI'm
not
listening
to
this.Sorry,
I've
gotta
go.-
Where
are
you
going?-
I'm
meeting
a
friend.A
girl?
Is
this
why
you
can't
decide?Bye.I
just
hope
she's
Bee-ish.They
have
a
huge
paradeof

every
year
in
Pasadena?To

the

every
florist's
dreamUp

Do
the

All

I've
got
one.How
come
you

exhausting.
Why

It's
faster.Yeah,
OK,
I

your
turn.TiVo.
You
can
just
freeze
live
TV?That's
insaneYou
don't
have
that?We
have
Hivo,
but
it's
a
disease.It's
a
horrible,
horrible
disease.Oh,
my.Dumb
beesYou
must
want
to
sting
all
those
jerks.We
try
not
to
sting.It's
usually
fatal
for
us.So
you
have
to
watch
your
temper.Very
carefully.You
kick
a
wall,
take
a
walk,write
an
angry
letter
and
throw
it
out.Work
through
it
like
any
emotion:Anger,
jealousy,
lust.Oh,
my
goodness
Are
you
OK?Yeah.-
What
is

Frosting...-
How
many

one.
I
try
notto
use
the
competition.So
why
are
you
helping
me?Bees
have
good
qualities.And
it
takes
my
mind
off
the
shop.Instead
of
flowers,
peopleare
giving
balloon
bouquets
now.Those
are
great,
if
you're
three.And
artificial
flowers.-
Oh,
those
just
get
me
psychotic-
Yeah,
me
too.Bent
stingers,
pointless

must
hate
those

worsethan

a

This

sure
you

go

I

When

can't

to

we

I
find

do
you?-
No.-
I
couldn't

No.-
No.Because

Mr.
Sting,
thank

for

name
intrigues
me.-
Where
have
I
heard
it
before?-
I
was
with
a
band
called
The
Police.But
you've
never
beena
police
officer,
have
you?No,
I
haven't.No,
you
haven't.
And
so
herewe
have
yet
another
exampleof

casuallystolen
by
a
humanfor
nothing
more
thana
prance-about
stage
name.Oh,
please.Have
you
ever
been
stung,
Mr.
Sting?Because
I'm
feelinga
little
stung,
Sting.Or
should
I
say...
Mr.
Gordon

not
his
real

Thank

see
from
your
resumethat
you're
devilishly
handsomewith
a
churning
inner
turmoilthat's
ready
to
blow.I
enjoy
what
I
do.
Is
that
a
crime?Not
yet
it
isn't.
But
is
thiswhat
it's
come
to
for
you?Exploiting

is
a

doesn't
someone
just
step
onthis
creep,
and
we
can
all
go
home?-
Order
in
this
court-
You're
all
thinking
itOrder
Order,
I
say-
Say
it-
Mr.
Liotta,
please
sit
downI
think
it
was
awfully
niceof
that
bear
to
pitch
in
like
that.I
think
the
jury's
on
our
side.Are
we
doing
everything
right,
legally?I'm
a
florist.Right.
Well,
here's
to
a
great
team.To
a
great
teamWell,
hello.-
Ken-
Hello.I
didn't
think
you
were
coming.No,
I
was
just
late.I
tried
to
call,
but...
the
battery.I
didn't
want
all
this
to
go
to
waste,so
I
called
Barry.
Luckily,
he
was
free.Oh,
that
was
lucky.There's
a
little
left.I
could
heat
it
up.Yeah,
heat
it
up,
sure,
whatever.So
I
hear
you're
quite
a
tennis
player.I'm
not
much
for
the
game
myself.The
ball's
a
little
grabby.That's
where
I
usually
sit.Right...
there.Ken,
Barry
was
looking
at
your
resume,and
he
agreed
with
me
that
eating
withchopsticks
isn't
really
a
special
skill.You
think
I
don't
see
what
you're
doing?I
know
how
hard
it
is
to
findthe
rightjob.
We
have
that
in
common.Do
we?Bees
have
100
percent
employment,but
we
do
jobs
like
taking
the
crud
out.That's
just
whatI
was
thinking
about
doing.Ken,
I
let
Barry
borrow
your
razorfor
his
fuzz.
I
hope
that
was
all
right.I'm
going
to
drain
the
old
stinger.Yeah,
you
do
that.Look
at
that.You
know,
I've
just
about
had
itwith
your
little
mind
games.-
What's
that?-

I
just
can't
seem
to
recall
thatI
think

sorry
about
all
that.I
know
it's
gotan
aftertaste
I
like
itI
always
felt
there
was
some
kindof
barrier
between
Ken
and
me.I
couldn't
overcome
it.Oh,
well.Are
you
OK
for
the
trial?I
believe
Mr.
Montgomeryis
about
out
of
ideas.We
would
like
to
callMr.
Barry
Benson
Bee
to
the
stand.Good
idea
You
can
really
see
why
he'sconsidered
one
of
the
best
lawyers...Yeah.Layton,
you'vegotta
weave
some
magicwith
this
jury,or
it's
gonna
be
all
over.Don't
worry.
The
only
thing
I
haveto
do
to
turn
this
jury
aroundis
to
remind
themof
what
they
don't
like
about
bees.-
You
got
the
tweezers?-
Are
you
allergic?Only
to
losing,
son.
Only
to
losing.Mr.
Benson
Bee,
I'll
ask
youwhat
I
think
we'd
all
like
to
know.What
exactly
is
your
relationshipto
that
woman?We're
friends.-
Good
friends?-
Yes.How
good?
Do
you
live
together?Wait
a
minute...Are
you
her
little......bedbug?I've
seen
a
bee
documentary
or
two.From
what
I
understand,doesn't
your
queen
give
birthto
all
the
bee
children?-
Yeah,
but...-
So
those
aren't
your
real
parents-
Oh,

a

against
the
beesyesterday
when
one
of
their
legalteam
stung
Layton
T.
Montgomery.-
Hey,
buddy.-
Hey.-
Is
there
much
pain?-
Yeah.I...I
blew
the
whole

didn't
I?It
doesn't
matter.
What
matters
isyou're
alive.
You
could
have
died.I'd
be
better
off
dead.
Look
at
me.They
got
it
from
the
cafeteriadownstairs,
in
a
tuna
sandwich.Look,
there'sa
little
celery
still
on
it.What
was
it
like
to
sting
someone?I
can't
explain
it.
It
was
all...All
adrenaline
and
then...and
then
ecstasyAll
right.You
think
it
was
all
a
trap?Of
course.
I'm
sorry.I
flew
us
right
into
this.What
were
we
thinking?
Look
at
us.
We'rejust
a
couple
of
bugs
in
this
world.What
will
the
humans
do
to
usif
they
win?I
don't
know.I
hear
they
put
the
roaches
in
motels.That
doesn't
sound
so
bad.Adam,
they
check
in,but
they
don't
check
outOh,
my.Oould
you
get
a
nurseto
close
that
window?-
Why?-
The
smoke.Bees
don't
smoke.Right.
Bees
don't
smoke.Bees
don't
smokeBut
some
bees
are
smoking.That's
it
That's
our
caseIt
is?
It's
not
over?Get
dressed.
I've
gotta
go
somewhere.Get
back
to
the
court
and
stall.Stall
any
way
you
can.And
assuming
you've
done
step
correctly,
you're
ready
for
the
tub.Mr.
Flayman.Yes?
Yes,
Your
HonorWhere
is
the
rest
of
your
team?Well,
Your
Honor,
it's
interesting.Bees
are
trained
to
fly
haphazardly,and
as
a
result,we
don't
make
very
good
time.I
actually
heard
a
funny
story
about...Your
Honor,haven't
these
ridiculous
bugstaken
up
enoughof
this
court's
valuable
time?How
much
longer
will
we
allowthese
absurd
shenanigans
to
go
on?They
have
presented
no
compellingevidence
to
support
their
chargesagainst
my
clients,who
run
legitimate
businesses.I
move
for
a
complete
dismissalof
this
entire
caseMr.
Flayman,
I'm
afraid
I'm
goingto
have
to
considerMr.
Montgomery's
motion.But
you
can't
We
have
a
terrific
case.Where
is
your
proof?Where
is
the
evidence?Show
me

is
that?It's

this?This
harmless

alone
a
bee.Look
at
what
has
happenedto
bees
who
have
never
been
asked,"Smoking

non?"Is
this
what
nature
intended
for
us?To
be
forcibly
addictedto

You

what
this
means?All
the
honeywill
finally
belong
to
the

we
won't
haveto
work
so
hard
all
the

is
an
unholy
perversionof
the

of
nature,
Benson.You'll
regret
this.Barry,
how
much
honey
is
out
there?All
right.
One
at
a

who
are
you
wearing?My
sweater
is
Ralph

I

What

What
do
you
mean?We've
been
living

waya
long
time,
27
million
years.Oongratulations
on
your
victory.What
will
you
demand
as
a
settlement?First,
we'll
demand
a
complete
shutdownof
all
bee
work
camps.Then
we
want
back
the
honeythat
was
ours
to
begin
with,every
last
drop.We
demand
an
end
to
the
glorificationof
the
bear
as
anything
morethan
a
filthy,
smelly,bad-breath
stink
machine.We're
all
awareof

out.He'll
have
nauseousfor
a
few

then
he'll

we
just
passed
three

there's

you
wouldn't
believehow
much
honey
was
out
there.Oh,
yeah?What's
going
on?
Where
is
everybody?-
Are
they
out
celebrating?-
They're
home.They
don't
know
what
to
do.Laying
out,
sleeping
in.I
heard
your
Uncle
Oarl
was
on
his
wayto
San
Antonio
with
a
cricket.At
least
we
got
our
honey
back.Sometimes
I
think,
so
what
if
humansliked
our
honey?
Who
wouldn't?It's
the
greatest
thing
in
the
worldI
was
excited
to
be
part
of
making
it.This
was
my
new
desk.
This
was
mynew
job.
I
wanted
to
do
it
really
well.And
now...Now
I
can't.I
don't
understandwhy
they're
not
happy.I
thought
their
lives
would
be
betterThey're
doing
nothing.
It's
amazing.Honey
really
changes
people.You
don't
have
any
ideawhat's
going
on,
do
you?-
What
did
you
want
to
show
me?-
This.What
happened
here?That
is
not
the
half
of
it.Oh,
no.
Oh,
my.They're
all
wilting.Doesn't
look
very
good,
does
it?No.And
whose
fault
do
you
think
that
is?You
know,
I'm
gonna
guess
bees.Bees?Specifically,
me.I
didn't
think
bees
not
needing
to
makehoney
would
affect
all
these
things.It's
notjust
flowers.Fruits,
vegetables,
they
all
need
bees.That's
our
whole
SAT
test
right
there.Take
away
produce,
that
affectsthe
entire
animal
kingdom.And
then,
of
course...The
human
species?So
if
there's
no
more
pollination,it
could
all
just
go
south
here,couldn't
it?I
know
this
is
also
partly
my
fault.How
about
a
suicide
pact?How
do
we
do
it?-
I'll
sting
you,
you
step
on
me.-
Thatjust
kills
you
twice.Right,
right.Listen,
Barry...sorry,
but
I
gotta
get
going.I
had
to
open
my
mouth
and
talk.Vanessa?Vanessa?
Why
are
you
leaving?Where
are
you
going?To

final
Tournament

of
is.I've
ruined
the

wanted

made
it
worse.Actually,
it's
completely
closed
down.I
thought
maybe
you
were
remodeling.But
I
have
another
idea,
and
it'sgreater
than
my
previous
ideas
combined.I
don't
want
to
hear
itAll
right,
they
have
the
roses,the
roses
have
the
pollen.I
know
every
bee,
plantand

in
this

we
gotta
do
is
get

pilot?He's
unconscious,and
so
is
the
copilot.Not
good.
Does
anyone
onboardhave
flight
experience?As
a
matter
of
fact,
there
is.-
Who's
that?-
Barry
Benson.From
the
honey
trial?
Oh,
great.Vanessa,
this
is
nothing
morethan
a
big
metal
bee.It's
got
giant
wings,
huge
engines.I
can't
fly
a
plane.-
Why
not?
Isn't
John
Travolta
a
pilot?-
Yes.How
hard
could
it
be?Wait,
BarryWe're
headed
into
some
lightning.This
is
Bob
Bumble.
We
have
somelate-breaking
news
from
JFK
Airport,where
a
suspenseful
sceneis
developing.Barry
Benson,fresh
from
his
legal
victory...That's
Barry...is
attempting
to
land
a
plane,loaded
with
people,
flowersand
an
incapacitated
flight
crew.Flowers?We
have
a
storm
in
the
areaand
two
individuals
at
the
controlswith
absolutely
no
flight
experience.Just
a
minute.There's
a
bee
on
that
plane.I'm
quite
familiar
with
Mr.
Bensonand
his
no-account
compadres.They've
done
enough
damage.But
isn't
he
your
only
hope?Technically,
a
beeshouldn't
be
able
to
fly
at
all.Their
wings
are
too
small...Haven't
we
heard
this
a
million
times?"The
surface
area
of
the
wingsand
body
mass
make
no
sense."-
Get
this
on
the
air-
Got
it.-
Stand
by.-
We're
going
live.The
way
we
work
may
be
a
mystery
to
you.Making
honey
takes
a
lot
of
beesdoing
a
lot
of
small
jobs.But
let
me
tell
you
about
a
small
job.If
you
do
it
well,it
makes
a
big
difference.More
than
we
realized.To
us,
to
everyone.That's
why
I
want
to
get
beesback
to
working
together.That's
the
bee
wayWe're
not
made
of
Jell-O.We
get
behind
a
fellow.-
Black

HelloLeft,

Hover?-
Forget
hover.This
isn't
so
hard.Beep-beep
Beep-beepBarry,
what
happened?Wait,
I
think
we
wereon
autopilot
the
whole
time.-
That
may
have
been
helping
me.-
And
now
we're
notSo
it
turns
out
I
cannot
fly
a
plane.All
of
you,
let's
getbehind

fellow
Move

only
chance
is
if
I
do

I'd
do,you

have
to
yell.I'm
not

in
a
lot
of

very
hard
