**Project Status: Finished**

This is a project that uses the openCV library for python to follow an object that is selected by the user. To select an object to follow make sure it is in frame of the camera before the program starts. When the program starts you will be able to hold down the mouse button and draw a rectangle to create a bounding box around an object. Note during this time the program will be frozen on the first frame and there will be no live video feed. Once the bounding box has been set press either the ```ENTER``` or ```SPACE``` key to start the video feed and watch the tracker do it's magic.

To install the required dependencies for this project, download this REPO, change directory into the repo's directory and run the command ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## TODO:
- Add a gif of the program working to the readme as an example
